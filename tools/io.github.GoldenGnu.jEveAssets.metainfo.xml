                    <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong>
                    -Removed outbid auto-update due to impact on esi

                    -Added advanced contracting to the slots tool (Reported by MagnarM)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Statement regarding removing features:</strong>

                    jEveAssets outbid auto update had a negative impact on ESI (and thereby Eve) - that is not
                    acceptable! ESI is a shared resource and that means everyone who use it have to use it responsible.
                    In this case the means I had to remove the functionality from jEveAssets, which isn't something I
                    like doing, but, it had to be done to be a good esi citizen, which is absolutely required.
