# SVN Checkout #

We usually work in two branches:
  * New Features:  
https://github.com/GoldenGnu/jeveassets/branches/feature-branch
  * Bug Fixes:  
https://github.com/GoldenGnu/jeveassets/trunk/

Bug fixes are committed to both branches.  
Experimental features get their own branch.  
The feature branch is merged back into trunk after release.
